""" Implement Car class:
Car: the constructor for car must take two arg. the first of them is its maximum speed, and the second is a string that denotes the units in which speed . Given: either "km/h" or "mph". The class must be implemented to return a string  based on the args. For example, if car is an object of class Car with maximum speed 120, and the unit is "km/h", then print _car_ prints the following string: "Car with the maximum speed of 120 km/h", without quotes. if the max speed is 94 and the know is "mph", then printing prints in the following string: "Car with maximum speed of 94 mph", without  quotes.
